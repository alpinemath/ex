# The Alpine Mathematics Expansions and Examples Library

Proofscape is all about enriching the experience of reading and understanding
proofs. So, while the [HistArch](https://github.com/alpinemath/histarch) repo is
a place for strictly representing classic mathematics, as originally published,
the present repo -- called "Ex" for short -- is a place to "fill in the gaps."

Specifically, as the title suggests, this library is exclusively for expansions
and example explorers.

An expansion is a Proofscape deduction that fills in missing steps, to help
readers span the inferential jumps, leaps, and bounds taken in published
proofs.

Example explorers are Proofscape annotations that use the `param` and `disp`
widget types to build interactive displays where users can quickly dial in
different combinations of parameters, and see computed examples displayed
immediately.


## How to contribute?

Contributing is easy. Basically, just fork this repository, add or improve some
modules, and make a pull request. However, please be sure to read the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first, and follow the guidelines stated
there.

The easiest way to develop Proofscape modules is by
[downloading and running PISE](https://alpinemath.org/download/pise.html),
the Proofscape Integrated Study Environment, on your own computer.

For an intro to PISE, you might want to try out
